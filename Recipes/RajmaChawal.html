<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Soak rajma overnight and pressure cook till they are soft</strong>
        <p>Wash the rajma and allow it to soak in water overnight. Wash it again and pressure cook with 2 cups of water, 1/2 tsp salt and turmeric. Once the rajma is soft and squishy, remove it from the heat and keep it aside.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Chop onion-tomato and make ginger-garlic paste</strong>
        <p>Finely chop onions and keep aside, grate the tomatoes and keep them aside. Make a paste of ginger, garlic and green chillies.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the rajma</strong>
        <p>In a deep bottomed pan, add mustard oil, when it gets heated add green cardamom, black cardamom, cinnamon, clove, peppercorn. Once they become fragrant, add onions and cook till they are golden brown. Now add the tomatoes and cook on high for 4-5 minutes. Add ginger- garlic-chilli paste, cumin powder, coriander powder and black pepper powder. Cook till the spices become fragrant and oil starts leaving the sides of the pan. Now add the rajma and one cup of water. Mix well and cook covered for 10 minutes. Once done, add the ghee. You can garnish with coriander leaves. Your rajma is ready.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Steam cook rice and serve with Rajma</strong>
        <p>To make steamed rice without using a pressure cooker, wash 1 cup of rice in running water. Then, add them to a large and deep-bottomed pan with 4-5 cups of water in it. You can also add a little salt to it for taste. Once the rice is soft and double its size, strain the water. Spread the rice on a plate and allow it to cool for 2-3 minutes. Once the rice is done, serve hot with prepared Rajma.</p>
